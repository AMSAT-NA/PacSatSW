 This the rt-ihu.git repository.

If you plan to use TI's HALCoGen, please fetch everything from the "hcg" directory on the repo and then
tell HALCoGen to open a project and point to the .rtihu.hcg file as a start.  Be sure to include the source
and header files because HALCoGen will read them and modify them rather than totally writing over them.
